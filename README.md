## Installation and Setup

Here are the steps to get the frontend of the MERN Stack Blogify Project up and running on your local machine:

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    Clone the frontend repository from GitHub. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blogify-frontend.git
    ```

2. **Install the Dependencies**

    Navigate into the cloned project directory and install the necessary packages using npm.

    ```bash
    cd blogify

-frontend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

    Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory and set up your environment variables. For example:

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

    Replace `http://localhost:5000/api` with the base URL of your backend API if it is hosted somewhere else.

4. **Start the Server**

    Now, you can start the server by running the start script defined in `package.json`.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000 or your specified PORT.
